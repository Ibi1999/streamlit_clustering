        1. **Select the competition** (e.g., Champions League or Premier League).
        2. **Choose a feature set** (Attacking, Defensive, Possession & Passing).
        3. **Pick the number of clusters (k)** using the slider.
        4. Click **Run Clustering** to generate:
            - Visualizations (2D & 3D)
            - Cluster summaries
            - A detailed output dataframe.
